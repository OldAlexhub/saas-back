# TaxiOps backend review

## Current coverage
- **Configuration & startup hardening** – the config layer now validates all required secrets, prepares a persistent vehicle upload directory, and exposes shared JWT + Mongo settings that the rest of the app reuses. 【F:config/index.js†L1-L36】
- **Express host with observability** – middleware boots CORS, Helmet, cookie parsing, body limits, and a request duration logger, serves `/public`, answers `/health`, and only starts listening after MongoDB is reachable while centralizing 404/error handling. 【F:server.js†L17-L65】
- **Authenticated admin surface** – routes mount admin signup/login plus approval toggles and then gate every operational resource behind JWT authentication and an admin role check. 【F:routes/routes.js†L52-L92】【F:middleware/auth.js†L5-L41】
- **Driver lifecycle management** – CRUD handlers validate DOB/licence expiries, normalize emails, hash and strip SSNs, and maintain an audit trail via schema hooks. 【F:controllers/Drivers.js†L24-L220】【F:models/DriverSchema.js†L1-L74】
- **Vehicle registry with file retention** – vehicles enforce uniqueness on cab/VIN/plate, compute age from the model year, persist inspection uploads to disk, remove superseded files, and append granular change history. 【F:controllers/Vehicles.js†L7-L104】【F:models/VehicleSchema.js†L1-L45】
- **Active driver & shift tracking** – Active endpoints whitelist mutable fields, normalize raw lat/lng into GeoJSON, diff changes into a history log, expose status/availability toggles, and support proximity searches via the 2dsphere index. 【F:controllers/Activate.js†L1-L216】【F:models/ActiveSchema.js†L1-L99】
- **End-to-end booking operations** – booking controllers enforce lead times, guard double-booking via conflict windows, offer manual or automatic dispatching, manage status transitions with timestamp stamping, and retain audit entries for create/update/assign/cancel flows—while capturing driver-initiated flagdowns under the same fare + history model. 【F:controllers/Booking.js†L1-L360】【F:models/BookingSchema.js†L1-L214】
- **Driver mobile surface** – dedicated `/driver-app` routes let authenticated drivers log in, review assignments, acknowledge dispatches, capture flagdown trips, stream trip locations, progress ride statuses, and publish availability/location updates with roster history tracking. 【F:routes/driverApp.js†L1-L32】【F:controllers/DriverAppAuth.js†L1-L129】【F:controllers/DriverApp.js†L6-L657】
- **Fare table singleton** – fare endpoints keep pricing in a single mutable document and validate all updates, giving dispatch an authoritative fare source. 【F:controllers/Fares.js†L1-L64】
- **Resilient Mongo connection** – the database helper deduplicates connection attempts, tunes selection timeouts, logs disconnects, and closes cleanly on process termination. 【F:db/connectTodb.js†L1-L36】

## High-leverage additions
1. **Real-time dispatch feeds** – Active updates are currently write-only REST calls; layering Socket.IO or SSE on top of the existing location & availability history would let dispatch screens react instantly to driver motion or roster flips. 【F:controllers/Activate.js†L96-L216】
2. **Richer automatic assignment & ETA scoring** – the new automatic dispatch option picks the closest online driver inside a fixed radius. A follow-up service could rank candidates using live ETAs, traffic, and hours-of-service scoring, then call the existing assignment controller with additional context. 【F:controllers/Booking.js†L62-L360】【F:models/ActiveSchema.js†L41-L108】
3. **Session lifecycle hardening** – expand driver and admin auth with refresh tokens, forced logout on password resets, and device binding so lost phones can be revoked instantly. 【F:controllers/DriverAppAuth.js†L1-L129】【F:middleware/driverAuth.js†L1-L29】
4. **Proactive compliance alerts** – licence and fingerprint expiries plus HOS counters are stored but unmonitored. Schedule background jobs that scan the driver and active collections, create warning tasks, and notify admins before violations occur. 【F:controllers/Drivers.js†L24-L220】【F:models/ActiveSchema.js†L52-L108】
5. **Notification pipeline** – booking flows capture status changes yet no rider/driver messaging is sent. Integrate SMS/push/email hooks on creation, assignment, and cancellation so stakeholders receive real-time updates. 【F:controllers/Booking.js†L100-L360】
6. **Fare estimation & billing** – bookings accept `estimatedFare` input but do not derive it; connect to the fare singleton to calculate quotes, store meter vs final fare breakdowns, and emit invoice artifacts for finance systems. 【F:controllers/Booking.js†L132-L360】【F:models/BookingSchema.js†L49-L106】
7. **Operational analytics & exports** – history arrays on drivers, vehicles, actives, and bookings capture rich context. Add reporting endpoints or scheduled exports that aggregate KPIs (utilization, on-time pickup rate, compliance trends) for leadership dashboards. 【F:controllers/Drivers.js†L24-L220】【F:controllers/Vehicles.js†L66-L104】【F:controllers/Activate.js†L120-L216】【F:controllers/Booking.js†L132-L360】

Use this list to prioritize features once the current foundation is deployed in staging; each item builds directly on persisted data the service is already collecting.
